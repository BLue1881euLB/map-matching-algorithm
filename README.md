map-matching-algorithm
======================


###Description

Here is some open source map matching algorithms for map vehicle track to real road network.


###Features

1.	Use map grid to speed up map point to road.
2.	Build map index speed up by multi_thread and store preprocess result in the first index time.
3.	Use ACE as server framework.
4.	Works as an http server, and json as communication format.
5.	Multi algorithms support.
